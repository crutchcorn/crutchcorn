Hi there! I'm Corbin: A Staff Frontend Developer, [GitHub Star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/crutchcorn/), developer, and teacher. This is my profile page to outline some of the things I'm working on today.



<h1><span aria-hidden="true">📚</span> Content</h1>

I've created a wide array of forms of content. I'm passionate about communication between developers and want to do my best to enhance the learning experience that other developers experience.

<h2><span aria-hidden="true">✍️</span> Writing</h2>

I've written 100K+ words on a wide range of programming topics. Among them are:


- [50+ articles for the blog, Unicorn Utterances](https://crutchcorn.dev)
- [What is Aggregation in MongoDB?](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/aggregation)
- [Add SMS Verification to React Native App Using Node.js and Express](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/2020/05/26/add-sms-verification-in-a-react-native-app-using-node-js-and-express-dr)
- [Integrating Shoelace with NextJS](https://next.shoelace.style/tutorials/integrating-with-nextjs)
- [HERE Map's React Tutorial](https://developer.here.com/tutorials/react)

I'm also writing a book trilogy called "The Framework Field Guide", which will teach React, Angular, and Vue all in one book! Click on the image below to learn more:

On top of a [small foray into TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@crutchcorn/video/7083240403318721838), [I'm a Twitch affiliate with over 1,500 followers](https://twitch.tv/crutchcorn). I stream regularly, often 6-8 hours a week, every week.

I do my best to engage with the community as much as possible, and have continued to host [charity Livestream events](https://theframedrops.com/), where we've even previously garnered $3k for charity!

I also host a [Discord community for others on Twitch to be able to talk to me](https://discord.gg/FMcvc6T) and do pair-progamming in office hours in order to help solve some of their problems.
