![Hi, I'm Corbin Crutchley, developer and teacher](./header.png)

Hi there! I'm Corbin: A Senior Frontend Developer, Founder of [OceanBit](https://oceanbit.dev), developer, and teacher. This is my profile page to outline some of the things I'm working on today.



<h1><span aria-hidden="true">📚</span> Content</h1>

I've created a wide array of forms of content. I'm passionate about communication between developers and want to do my best to enhance the learning experience that other developers experience.

<h2><span aria-hidden="true">✍️</span> Writing</h2>

<a href="https://unicorn-utterances.com"><img alt="" width="128" height="128"  align="right" src="uu_logo.png"/></a>

I've written 100K+ words on a wide range of programming topics. Among them are:


- [45+ articles for the blog, Unicorn Utterances](https://crutchcorn.dev)
- [What is Aggregation in MongoDB?What is Aggregation in MongoDB?](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/aggregation)
- [Add SMS Verification to React Native App Using Node.js and Express](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/2020/05/26/add-sms-verification-in-a-react-native-app-using-node-js-and-express-dr)
- [Integrating Shoelace with NextJS](https://next.shoelace.style/tutorials/integrating-with-nextjs)
- [HERE Map's React Tutorial](https://developer.here.com/tutorials/react)

I'm also writing a book trilogy called "The Framework Field Guide", which will teach React, Angular, and Vue all in one book! Click on the image below to learn more:

On top of a [small foray into TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@crutchcorn/video/7083240403318721838), [I'm a Twitch affiliate with over 1,000 followers](https://twitch.tv/crutchcorn). I stream regularly, often 6-8 hours a week, every week.

I do my best to engage with the community as much as possible, and have continue to host [charity Livestream events](https://theframedrops.com/), where we've even previously garnered $3k for charity!

I also host a [Discord community for others on Twitch to be able to talk to me](https://discord.gg/FMcvc6T) and do pair-progamming in office hours in order to help solve some of their problems.

<h2><span aria-hidden="true">🤔</span> Projects</h2>

<h3><span aria-hidden="true">🐳</span> StreamPods</h3>

StreamPods is my home-grown code-powered livestreaming overlay system. It responds to Twitch notifications (like donations, redeems, and more) as well as chat. It also provides an amazing developer experience to build your own customizations and themes on top of the pre-built elements. Total customization at your hands.

Here's what my overlay looks like:

![A highlighted message showing up in overlay with chat](https://cdn.crutchcorn.com/github/highlight-msg.gif)

> Remember, all of this is completely custom-written code powering the show. No OBS in this video

Here's a Twitter thread of just some of what you can do with StreamPods:

> StreamPods is also our test-bed for a new SSR framework that I will be turning into a dedicated package fairly soon. So you'll be able to see the source code before it goes live! Curious to hear more? [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/crutchcorn)

<h3><span aria-hidden="true">🏖️</span> Seaside</h3>

Seaside is OceanBit's internal UI component system for React and React Native. Fully accessible, highly customizable, stable, beautiful.

Here's a tiny sample:

Designed by [Eduardo Pratti](https://twitter.com/edpratti/) and [Kevin Aguilar](https://dribbble.com/kevttob), accessibility help from [Evelyn Hathaway](https://github.com/evelynhathaway/) and others, and dev-first API patterns.
